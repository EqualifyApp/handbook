# The Equalify Handbook

## What is the purpose of a handbook?
Inspired by [Gitlab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), Equalify's handbook provides information about Equalify operations. Publishing this information encourages a culture of openness, helping us make the internet more accessible.

## What is Equalify?

Equalify is a platform for managing website accessibility. 

Our service builds dynamic reports of website accessibility over digital assets. We also integrate with existing accessibility services, providing a single dashboard for all their web accessibility needs.

## What are Equalify's values?

**Equalify values access above all else.** We are driven by the belief that everyone should have access to the internet tools and information they need. That value pushes us to build a culture of openness that values mutual respect and the free exchange of information to reach better metrically defined solutions.

## How does Equalify promote access?

Equalify's tools test the usability of digital assets. Most of our tools promote compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) so that people with disabilities can access the internet.

Beyond our tools, we make our code and company information available to anyone.

Our core code contribution guidelines also value easily understandable code written in well-known languages.

Organizational information, policies, and procedures are published here in our handbook (https://github.com/equalifyapp/handbook). 

By becoming a transparent organization, our work benefits as many people as possible.

## How is Equalify sustained?

Equalify sells subscriptions to a platform that manages web accessibility. From the single platform, users can test and fix accessibility issues, integrating a suite of easy-to-use services. 

Subscriptions include monthly storage, users, and scan allowances.

We currently target organizations that can pay around $25,000 a year. Focusing on those larger accounts allows us to sustain our development team while limiting the number of organizations we support.

## What are Equalify's plans?

All of our development makes the web more accessible.

In the near term, we are focusing on building a business (see [Business.md](/Business.md)) that can sustain Equalify. We are also building out this notebook to engrain a culture of transparency in all we do.

As soon as we have reached a stable foundation for growth, we aim to offer managed services that are more affordable to freelancers and smaller organizations. 

In the meantime, smaller organizations can always spin up open-source Equalify tools published to [https://github.com/equalifyapp](https://github.com/equalifyapp). 

We constantly seek new contributions and issues as we build a community and service that helps make the web more accessible.
