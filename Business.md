## What does Equalify sell?

Equalify sells subscriptions for managed hosting and support of our open-source code.

## What's included with subscriptions?

We include a set amount of user accounts, scans, and storage with every subscription. 

## How much do subscriptions cost?

Subscriptions to Equalify's managed hosting and support start at $25,000 per year. This includes the ability to maintain WCAG compliance for up to 25,000 digital web pages and PDFs, with multiple users supported. Our focus is currently on serving larger organizations that can afford this price point, as we aim to provide excellent support while also building systems to support customers with smaller needs.

## Is anyone funding Equalify's initial work?
Blake Bertuccelli-Booth ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)) is funding Equalify’s initial work. Blake is taking meetings with possible investors to keep his options open, but his primary focus is on getting sales. We have also received support from our open source community, [Decubing Web Services](https://decubing.com/), [CivicActions](http://civicactions.com/), and [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/).

## What are Equalify's sales goals?

Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000, reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $500,000. That ARR proves our product and provides the groundwork for additional fundraising. Fundraising would provide a runway allowing us to hire a small team to scale confidently.

## What is Equalify's sales strategy?
Equalify has a three-tiered sales process that moves from generating leads to developing ambassadors to contracting customers. Each of these phases represents a different stage in our efforts to reach our sales goals and build relationships with our customers.

### Generating Leads
We generate leads by joining and participating in Slack channels for groups related to accessibility and interest groups, sponsoring accessibility mixers at conferences, submitting talks to conferences, deploying outreach campaigns with partners, distributing case studies to related organizations, including stakeholders in open-source design process, and deploying open-source and managed features that interest target users and lead to sales. To qualify as a Lead, the individual must have a discussion with us in which they express interest in Equalify and affirm that their organization can pay for the $25,000 price tag.

Common job titles for leads include “Senior Technical Project Manager,” “Senior Strategist,” “Senior Web Accessibility Administrator,” “IT Architect,”“Technical Lead,” “Senior Manager,” “Web Operations Manager,” “Product Manager,” “Product Owner,” and “Accessibility Director.”

### Developing Ambassadors
Leads become Ambassadors when they offer to help get Equalify purchased by their organization. We create proposals for Ambassadors, including pre-visualizations of the service and additional sales materials that the Ambassador requests. Ambassadors usually need 2-12 months to build consensus and contract products. During that time, Equalify regularly checks on the ambassador's progress and provides additional materials if necessary.

### Contracting Customers
Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000. Contracts outline allowances of scans, storage, and users, and also include support information and billing terms. Once an agreement is approved, we send a bill via Stripe. Some contracts stipulate features that we still need to deploy, which require a 50% upfront payment of the contracted amount. We bill the remaining 50% on feature deployment. Once a bill has been paid, the contract is executed and an organization's main support contact will be sent credentials to start using Equalify.

## How does Equalify handle accounting and customer data?

Initial sales pay expenses and Blake's salary, helping him devote more time to reaching business goals. Once he has reached a fair salary, he will continues embarks on hiring a team (see Budget.md).
