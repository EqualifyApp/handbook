# Business

This document provides an overview of Equalify's business model and how we aim to sustain our open-source project financially.

## Is open-source code bad for business?

Equalify believes that open-source code can actually benefit businesses in various ways:

- **Reduced development costs through community contributions**: Open-source software encourages outside developers to contribute to the project, which can lead to community contributions that lower development costs. This allows Equalify to focus on serving clients who lack technical resources or interest in contributing code.
- **Improved reputation and trust**: Open-source software can be more trustworthy and transparent than closed-source software. By making code open-source, a company can establish a reputation for openness, collaboration, and commitment to the community. This enhanced trust is particularly beneficial when working with public sector clients, who are Equalify's primary customers.
- **Access to a larger talent pool**: Many developers are passionate about open-source projects and prefer to work on those that align with their values. By contributing to open-source projects, companies can attract these developers and access a wider talent pool.
- **Simplified customization and integration**: Open-source software is typically easier to customize and integrate with other tools since the code is freely available and modifiable as needed. This can save businesses time and money when tailoring software to their unique requirements.

Given these advantages, Equalify is dedicated to releasing its code under open-source licenses and believes in the potential of community-driven development.

## How does Equalify generate revenue?

Equalify generates revenue by selling subscriptions for managed hosting and support of its open-source code.

## What do subscriptions include?

Subscriptions cover a specified number of user accounts, scans, and storage. Subscribers also gain access to multi-user features unavailable in open-source distributions.

## What is the cost of subscriptions?

Subscriptions for Equalify's managed hosting and support start at $25,000 per year. While we acknowledge that this price point may be prohibitive for smaller organizations, our current focus is on serving larger organizations that can afford the $25,000 annual fee. This allows us to provide exceptional support to these clients while we develop systems to accommodate customers with smaller needs.

## Who is funding Equalify's initial work?
Equalify receives support from our open-source community. That support comes in the form of code contributions and issue feedback. Cash needs, such as hosting and bug bounties, are covered by subscription revenues and the savings of Equalify's owner, Blake Bertuccelli-Booth ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)). See [/Accounting.md](/Accounting.md) for a detailed list of revenue, expenses, and budgeting.

## What are Equalify's sales goals?
Equalify aims to secure contracts valued at $25,000, reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $500,000. Achieving this ARR demonstrates the product's viability and lays the groundwork for additional fundraising, which would enable hiring a small team to scale confidently.

## What is Equalify's sales strategy?
Equalify employs a three-tiered sales process: generating leads, developing ambassadors, and contracting with customers. Each phase represents a different stage in the company's efforts to reach its sales goals and build relationships with customers.

### Generating Leads
Equalify identifies leads through various methods, such as participating in relevant Slack channels, sponsoring accessibility mixers at conferences, giving conference talks, conducting outreach campaigns with partners, distributing case studies, collaborating with prominent stakeholders on open-source features, and deploying features that interest target users and lead to sales. To qualify as a Lead, an individual must express interest in Equalify, confirm their organization can afford the $25,000 price tag, and engage in a conversation with us.

Common job titles for leads include "Senior Technical Project Manager," "Senior Strategist," "Senior Web Accessibility Administrator," "IT Architect," "Technical Lead," "Senior Manager," "Web Operations Manager," "Product Manager," "Product Owner," and "Accessibility Director."

### Developing Ambassadors
Leads become Ambassadors when they offer to help get Equalify purchased by their organization. We create proposals for Ambassadors, including pre-visualizations of the service and additional sales materials that the Ambassador requests. Ambassadors usually need 2-12 months to build consensus and contract products. During that time, Equalify regularly checks on the ambassador's progress and provides additional materials if necessary.

### Contracting Customers
Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000. Contracts outline allowances of scans, storage, and users, and also include support information and billing terms. Once an agreement is approved, we send a bill via Stripe. Some contracts stipulate features that we still need to deploy, which require a 50% upfront payment of the contracted amount. We bill the remaining 50% on feature deployment. Once a bill has been paid, the contract is executed and an organization's main support contact will be sent credentials to start using Equalify.
