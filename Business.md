# Business

## Equalify's code is open-source. Is open-source code bad for business?
Equalify believes that open-source code can actually be beneficial for businesses. Here's why:

- **Community contributions reduce development costs**: By releasing software as open source, companies invite outside developers to contribute to the project. This can leads to community contributions that reduce internet development costs. In turn, Equalify can focus on business that benefits clients who do not have technical resources or interest in contributing code.
- **Enhanced reputation and trust**: Open-source software is often seen as more trustworthy and transparent than closed-source software. By releasing code as open source, a company can build a reputation for openness, collaboration, and commitment to the community. Enhanced trust is especially useful when working with public sector clients, who are Equalify's primary customers.
- **Access to a broader talent pool**: Many developers are passionate about open source and prefer to work on projects that align with their values. By contributing to open-source projects, companies can attract these developers and tap into a wider talent pool.
- **Easier customization and integration**: Open-source software is often easier to customize and integrate with other tools, since the code is freely available and can be modified as needed. This can save time and money for businesses that need to tailor software to their specific needs.

For these reasons, Equalify is committed to releasing its code under open-source licenses and believes in the power of community-driven development.

## How does Equalify generate revenue?

Equalify sells subscriptions for managed hosting and support of its open-source code.

## What do subscriptions include?

Subscriptions include a set number of user accounts, scans, and storage. Additionally, subscribers receive access to multi-user features that are not available in open-source distributions.

## What is the cost of subscriptions?

Subscriptions to Equalify's managed hosting and support start at $25,000 per year. Equalify knows this price point is a limiting factor for smaller organizations. We are currently focused on serving a few larger organizations that can afford $25,000 per year in order to provide excellent support to those organizations while we build systems to accommodate customers with smaller needs.

## Is anyone funding Equalify's initial work?
We have received support from our open source community. Any cash needs (such as hosting and bug bounties) are paid by revenues from subscriptions and savings of Equalify's owner, Blake Bertuccelli-Booth ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)). See [/Accounting.md](/Accounting.md) for a detailed list of revenue, expeses and budgeting.

## What are Equalify's sales goals?
Equalify's goal is to secure contracts valued at $25,000, reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $500,000. This ARR demonstrates the product's viability and lays the foundation for additional fundraising, which would enable hiring a small team to scale confidently.

## What is Equalify's sales strategy?
Equalify employs a three-tiered sales process, moving from generating leads to developing ambassadors to contracting with customers. Each of these phases represents a different stage in the company's efforts to reach its sales goals and build relationships with customers.

### Generating Leads
Equalify identifies leads through various methods, including participating in relevant Slack channels, sponsoring accessibility mixers at conferences, giving conference talks, conducting outreach campaigns with partners, distributing case studies, collaborating with prominent stakeholders on open-source features, and deploying features that interest target users and lead to sales. To qualify as a Lead, an individual must express interest in Equalify, confirm their organization can afford the $25,000 price tag, and engage in a conversation with us.

Common job titles for leads include "Senior Technical Project Manager," "Senior Strategist," "Senior Web Accessibility Administrator," "IT Architect," "Technical Lead," "Senior Manager," "Web Operations Manager," "Product Manager," "Product Owner," and "Accessibility Director."

### Developing Ambassadors
Leads become Ambassadors when they offer to help get Equalify purchased by their organization. We create proposals for Ambassadors, including pre-visualizations of the service and additional sales materials that the Ambassador requests. Ambassadors usually need 2-12 months to build consensus and contract products. During that time, Equalify regularly checks on the ambassador's progress and provides additional materials if necessary.

### Contracting Customers
Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000. Contracts outline allowances of scans, storage, and users, and also include support information and billing terms. Once an agreement is approved, we send a bill via Stripe. Some contracts stipulate features that we still need to deploy, which require a 50% upfront payment of the contracted amount. We bill the remaining 50% on feature deployment. Once a bill has been paid, the contract is executed and an organization's main support contact will be sent credentials to start using Equalify.
