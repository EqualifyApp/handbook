# Business

## Equalify's code is open-source. Isn't open-source code bad for business?
No, working within an open-source license can actually be beneficial for businesses. Here are some reasons why:
- **Community contributions subsidize the cost of development**: When a company releases software as open source, it invites outside developers to contribute to the project. This can lead to faster development and more frequent updates, as well as new ideas and perspectives from contributors. In turn, the cost of development can be subsidized by the community, allowing the company to focus on other areas of the business.
- **Improved reputation and trust**: Open-source software is often seen as more trustworthy and transparent than closed-source software. By releasing code as open source, a company can build a reputation for being open, collaborative, and committed to the community.
- **Access to a wider talent pool**: Many developers are passionate about open source and prefer to work on projects that align with their values. By contributing to open-source projects, companies can attract these developers to their organization and tap into a wider talent pool.
- **Easier customization and integration**: Open-source software is often easier to customize and integrate with other tools, since the code is freely available and can be modified as needed. This can save time and money for businesses that need to tailor software to their specific needs.

For those reasons, we are committed to continuing to release our code under open-source licenses and believe in the power of community-driven development.

## How does Equalify make money?

Equalify sells subscriptions for managed hosting and support of our open-source code.

## What's included with subscriptions?

We include a set amount of user accounts, scans, and storage with every subscription. 

## How much do subscriptions cost?

Subscriptions to Equalify's managed hosting and support start at $25,000 per year. This includes the ability to maintain WCAG compliance for up to 25,000 digital web pages and PDFs, with multiple users supported. Our focus is currently on serving larger organizations that can afford this price point, as we aim to provide excellent support while also building systems to support customers with smaller needs.

## Is anyone funding Equalify's initial work?
Blake Bertuccelli-Booth ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)) is funding Equalify’s initial work. Blake is taking meetings with possible investors to keep his options open, but his primary focus is on getting sales. We have also received support from our open source community and in-kind support from employees of [Decubing Web Services](https://decubing.com/) and [CivicActions](http://civicactions.com/).

## What are Equalify's sales goals?
Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000, reaching an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $500,000. That ARR proves our product and provides the groundwork for additional fundraising. Fundraising would provide a runway allowing us to hire a small team to scale confidently.

## What is Equalify's sales strategy?
Equalify has a three-tiered sales process that moves from generating leads to developing ambassadors to contracting with customers. Each of these phases represents a different stage in our efforts to reach our sales goals and build relationships with our customers.

### Generating Leads
We find leads by joining and participating in Slack channels for groups related to accessibility and interest groups, sponsoring accessibility mixers at conferences, giving talks at conferences, deploying outreach campaigns with partners, distributing case studies to organizations that find them interesting, partnering with prominent stakeholders to design open-source features, and deploying features that interest target users and lead to sales. To qualify as a Lead, the individual must have a discussion with us in which they express interest in Equalify and affirm that their organization can pay for the $25,000 price tag.

Common job titles for leads include “Senior Technical Project Manager,” “Senior Strategist,” “Senior Web Accessibility Administrator,” “IT Architect,”“Technical Lead,” “Senior Manager,” “Web Operations Manager,” “Product Manager,” “Product Owner,” and “Accessibility Director.”

### Developing Ambassadors
Leads become Ambassadors when they offer to help get Equalify purchased by their organization. We create proposals for Ambassadors, including pre-visualizations of the service and additional sales materials that the Ambassador requests. Ambassadors usually need 2-12 months to build consensus and contract products. During that time, Equalify regularly checks on the ambassador's progress and provides additional materials if necessary.

### Contracting Customers
Our goal is to execute contracts valued at $25,000. Contracts outline allowances of scans, storage, and users, and also include support information and billing terms. Once an agreement is approved, we send a bill via Stripe. Some contracts stipulate features that we still need to deploy, which require a 50% upfront payment of the contracted amount. We bill the remaining 50% on feature deployment. Once a bill has been paid, the contract is executed and an organization's main support contact will be sent credentials to start using Equalify.

## How does Equalify handle accounting and customer data?

Initial sales pay expenses and Blake's salary, helping him devote more time to reaching business goals. Once he has reached a fair salary, he will continues embarks on hiring a team (see Budget.md).
