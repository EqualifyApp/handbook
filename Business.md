# Business

## What does Equalify sell?

Equalify sells subscriptions, managed hosting & support of our open-source code. In addition to unbeatable hosting & support, we offer multi-user account management for the large teams we hope to work for.

## How are plans priced?

Plans are priced at $25,000. Each plan includes a limited amount of user accounts, storage, and scans.

## Who are Equalify's target customers?

Equalify targets organizations that must maintain website accessibility of digital assets (web pages and PDFs) and can pay our $25,000 price tag.

Focusing on the larger organizations that can pay $25k allows us to provide excellent support to a limited amount of customers while we build systems to support customers with smaller needs.

## Is anyone funding Equalify's initial work?

Blake Bertuccelli-Booth ([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)) is funding Equalify’s initial work. Blake is taking meetings with possible investors to keep his options open, but his primary focus is on getting sales.

## What are Equalify's sales goals?

We aim to reach an annual reoccurring revenue (ARR) of $500,000. 

That ARR proves our product and provides the groundwork for additional fundraising. Fundraising would provide a runway allowing us to hire a small team to scale confidently.

## Why $500k?

While Blake is getting sales for Equalify, he will be hiring a team. $500k includes the cost of that team, plus modest expenses. (See [Budget.md](/Budget.md)).

## How does Equalify get sales?

Blake will lead a sales initiative to reach ARR targets.

The initiative will focus on executing contracts valued at $25,000. 

To get those contracts, Blake is deploying a three-tiered sales process. The sales process starts with generating "Leads," moving into developing "Ambassadors" before reaching the final goal: contracting customers.

### Generating Leads

Leads are folks who work for organizations that fit our targets (see [Who are Equalify's target Customers?](https://www.notion.so/Handbook-251adae7baf14609bde20a09e28505ac)). Leads also express some interest in better website accessibility management.

Common job titles for Leads include “Senior Technical Project Manager,” “Senior Strategist,” “Senior Web Accessibility Administrator,” “IT Architect,”“Technical Lead,” “Senior Manager,” “Web Operations Manager,” “Product Manager,” “Product Owner,” and “Accessibility Director.” 

An example of a good Lead is a Senior Manager who works for a Higher Ed organization and says they wish they had a feature like the features Equalify will provide.

The following industries provide most Leads, since they are required to deliver accessible content:

- Higher Education
- K-12 Education
- Federal Government
- State & Local Governments

To generate leads, Blake will:

- Join and participate in Slack channels for groups related to accessibility and interest groups.
- Sponsor accessibility mixers at conferences (WPCampus, BadCamp)
- Submit Talks to Conferences (HighEdWeb, WPCampus, Educause)
- Deploy outreach campaigns with partners.
    - Gov Reporting Outreach Campaign
    - HigherEd Outreach Campaign
- Distribution Case Studies to related organizations.
- Deploy open-source (e.g., Reporting) and managed (i.e., multi-user accounts) features that interest target user and lead to sales. *Note: all open-source features that Blake spends his time on will have to answer the question, "How does this feature lead to sustaining Equalify?".. working on these features is fun but doesn't often lead to sales.*
- Create Pre-visualizations of features that are developed after contracting a project.

To qualify as a Lead, Blake has to have a discussion in which a lead expresses interest in the Equalify project and affirms that their organization can pay for the $25,000 price tag.

Leads who do not interact with outreach activities or ask to be taken off mailing lists will be archived. 

### Developing Ambassadors

Ambassadors are Equalify cheerleaders within organizations. They have direct connections with those in charge of procurement within an organization. They also help Blake hone a proposal for the procurement officer and give Blake clear expectations on when Equalify will be contracted within their organization.

Leads become Ambassadors when they offer to help get Equalify purchased by their organization.

When a lead becomes an ambassador, Blake offers to create proposals. Proposals often include pre-visualizations of the service and additional sales materials that the Ambassador requests.

Ambassadors usually need 2-12 months to build consensus and contract products. During that time, Blake regularly checks on the Ambassador's progress, asking if the Ambassador needs additional materials.

Ambassadors who do not follow up in time they have suggested will be archived.

### Contracting Customers

Customers are the organizations that Equalify contracts with. Contracts focus on each client's number of scans, storage, and users. Contracts also include support information and billing terms (all warranties are annual for $25,000). Once an agreement is approved, we send a bill via Stripe.

Some contracts stipulate features that Equalify still needs to deploy. Those contracts require a 50% upfront payment of the contracted amount. We bill the remaining 50% on feature deployment.

On full payment, a one-year support term will begin, and the primary support contact will receive credentials where they can start using Equalify.

## How does Equalify handle accounting and data from customers or potential customers?

Stripe handles all customer billing data. We abide by the terms of the [Stripe service agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa). Stripe also sends bills and reports on progress to our all-important ARR goals.

We save additional user data on Equalify servers, and we maintain the terms of service of a contract.

Since we're a radically transparent organization, it's important to note that Equalify all data around customers or potential customers is private. That includes customer organizations, contact information, and notes on particular projects.

However, we publish our collected information (see [How does Equalify get sales?](https://www.notion.so/Handbook-251adae7baf14609bde20a09e28505ac)).

We will gladly share or delete any information on a customer's request.

## What will Blake do with income from initial sales?

Initial sales pay expenses and Blake's salary, helping him devote more time to reaching business goals. Once he has reached a fair salary, he will continues embarks on hiring a team (see Budget.md).

## How can people get in touch with Blake?

Anyone who is interested in purchasing Equalify or being an ambassador can email [hello@equalify.app](https://www.notion.so/Hello-Equalify-4bc5ad676b29415da30674ef1aa500eb)  Folks can also stay in touch via [Equalify’s Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/equalifyapp/shared_invite/zt-1sfbgf0fa-CzIHlbFOs0Ww1iSTK4LQ2w).
