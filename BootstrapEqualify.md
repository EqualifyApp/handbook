# "Bootstrap Equalify" Campaign

This document outlines the campaign to develop Equalify's business. The document will be updated as the campaign progresses.

## Goal

Secure a contract with one customer that meets our targets (see [/Business.md](/Business.md)) within seven weeks. Concurrently, identify new Leads and Ambassadors while refining the sales approach.

## Timeline

April 3 - May 26, with the possibility of extension if the campaign is successful. The timeline was set because it is before a Summer break. The Summer break (2 weeks) will be used to understand outcomes. 

## Collaborators
Blake([@bbertucc](https://github.com/bbertucc)) is leading a campaign to develop Equalify's business. Feeback will be requested from two networks of collaborators:
1. **Close Collaborators** includes contributors to the Equalify repo and folks in connected Equalify Slack channels. Sharing content with close collaborators should lead to better solutions.
2. **Community Collaborators** includes folks in related Slack channels (A11Y, HighEdWeb, and WPC) and existing Equalify users. 

In sharing any information with collaborators, there should be a clear ask. 

## Business Interest

Securing a contract with one customer will provide enough resources to continue building Equalify without the need for external investment. By demonstrating product viability and generating revenue from customers, we can maintain more control over the company and its direction, while potentially attracting better investment terms when needed.

## Milestones
- 4/3: Start work.
- 4/10: Commit and merge updates. They cannot be updated after this, unless mission critical issues.
- 4/28: Review action and adjust handbook accordingly.
- 5/1: Commit and merge updates. They cannot be updated after this, unless mission critical issues.
- 5/26: Last day of work. Review actions and set ideas before Summer Break. May come to new direction after Summer Break.

## Actions

The following actions align with the goals outlined in [/Business.md](/Business.md). Each action should have a metrically defined objective and schedule, along with potential next steps depending on whether those objectives are met.

### 4/3 - 6/19: Develop Handbook to Execute Intentional Actions

This entire campaign is an experiment to determine whether intentional actions yield positive results. The handbook will be updated regularly to organize actions. The goal is to secure a contract with one customer while understanding the process leading to that contract. Success will allow for the iteration of actions to grow sales, while failure will prompt a review of materials with trusted advisors and consideration of alternative approaches. (We'll also be testing how much is too much openness with public sharing of this handbook.)

The Handbook will be developed as part of other actions. These particular milestones can be scheduled:
- 4/3 - 4/6 (20 hrs): Research and brainstorm ideas to define and work toward business outcomes then share handbook with Close Collaborators (6/19), asking if they would like to be shared on future communication and if they have any additional ideas or questions to add to the campaign that could lead to desired results.
- 4/7 & 4/10 (3 hrs): Revise Handbook to Close Collaborator comments and set schedule in Google Calendar.
- 4/28 (3 hrs): Is handbook working toward goals? Assess and decide accordingly. 

### 4/13: Develop Customer Relationship Managment (CRM)
All aspects of this campaign are furthed by a CRM. The CRM would be an internal database of contacts, organized into categories discussed in [/Business.md](/Business.md). Every new contact would be put in this tool with tracking around last contacts. We'll probably use Notion to maintain our CRM.

The CRM will be developed as part of other actions. These particular milestones can be scheduled:
- 4/13 (3 hrs): Setup CRM fields in Notion and add existing contacts.

### 4/10 - 4/28: Develop & Release "Tulane Case Study"

Two centers at Tulane University have paid to manage their accessibility with Equalify. Upon deploying these solutions, a case study will be developed and shared with contacts in the higher education community via Slack and direct email. The objective is to finalize the case study by April 21 and generate at least 20 leads from sharing it in the week following. Meeting this objective will lead to a deeper focus on case studies and the potential for additional discounted work with other organizations. If the objective is not met, the value of case studies will be reevaluated.

The Tulane Case Study schedule is as follows:
- 4/3 - 4/7 (1 hrs): Finalize requirements.
- 4/10 - 4/13 (12 hrs): Testing, remediation, and training with first Tulane client. Log process.
- 4/14 (3 hrs): Finalize first case study and publish to close network. Update as needed.
- 4/17 - 4/20 (12 hrs): Testing, remediation, and training with second Tulane client. Log Process.
- 4/24 (3 hrs): Finalize second case study and publish to larger network. Update as needed.
- 4/24 - 4/27 (4 hrs): Update and adapt case study and website to meet goals set in Google Analytics.
- 4/28 (2 hrs): Review goals and decide next steps accordingly.

### 4/7 - 4/12: "Website 2.0" Launch Aligned with /Business.md Targets

The current website focuses on selling customized dashboard services. With the updated sales focus in [/Business.md](/Business.md), a redesign is necessary. The language will be updated to align with the new focus, and the call to action may be changed to "Request a demo" instead of "Contact Us." The website's effectiveness will be continually tested as the Tulane case study is released. During this period, the goal is to generate leads not directly emailed through the website. If leads are generated, the current approach will be iterated on; otherwise, alternative lead generation methods will be explored.

These "Website 2.0" requirements should help toward business goals: 
- Strict WCAG 2.1 AA conformance and accessibility testing.
- Clear call to action on every page, quantified by Google Analytics goals.
- Case studies area for successful case studies.

Web Website 2.0 schedule is as follows:
- 4/3 - 4/7 (1 hrs): Finalize requirements.
- 4/11 (4 hrs): Buildout first draft of website.
- 4/14 (1 hrs): Revisions and share draft to network of Close Collaborators.
- 4/17 (3 hrs): Revisions.
- 4/28 (3 hrs): Launch site to larger network of collaborators. The website will continuously be developed as part of other actions.

## Ideas

This running list serves as a rough collection of ideas for potential actions. While actions are carried out, these ideas will be seeded with collaborators:

- **Publish a Survey of Government + Higher Ed Accessibility**: The survey, done in partnership with CivicActions, would outline accessibility scores of major institutions. We would promote the survey to channels and individuals to generate Leads. Meeting with CivicActions on 4/14 to discuss the viability of this campaign to generate leads.
- **Sponsor WPCampus party**: WP Campus occurs after this campaign (7/14) but could be initiated if the campaign appears successful. This action would also help determine the value of sponsoring informal mixers.
- **Give a Talk at HighEdWeb**: The talk "Open Source Accessibility Tool Survey" has been approved for HighEdWeb (10/8-10/11). If the campaign is successful and extended, this event might be included. It will be interesting to see if talks generate new leads.
- **Co-Design new features with a prominent Lead**: Collaborating on feature design with a prominent Lead could serve as a calling card for Equalify. For example, co-designing the reports view with Berkeley could lead to more Leads and Ambassadors if the process and results of our collaboration is properly shared in relevant communities. Other co-design ideas include: an AI+A11Y tool, 
- **Take High-value Leads out to dinner**: A common sales approach is to take leads out to dinner. This strategy has produced mixed results in the past. The goal would be to convert leads into ambassadors, and this action would only be pursued if the Lead explicitly indicates that it would lead to a stronger connection.
- **Refocus the website on Custom Dashboard service**: If SaaS sales prove challenging, the custom dashboard service seems to be attracting interest. The downside is that custom dashboards do not scale as well as a SaaS service. A pivot to this approach should only be considered if SaaS sales prove unattainable.
- **AI + Accessibility Roundtable to Design Better Open Source A11Y+AI Solutions**: There is surprisingly scant information on how AI can improve WCAG 2.1 compliance now, and how WCAG can be adapted to better promote AI solutions. An AI + Accessibility roundable could bring together WCAG and AI pros. We could also introduce some data-sets we're working with. Desired outcome would be signup for building an open AI+A11Y solution with Equalify.
- **Promote Equalify Slack Channel to Gain Close Collaborators**: Close collaborators are first to vet ideas and so they can help work toward better business outcomes. Promoting a network of close collaborators, especially to folks within the target audience, will improve results of this and other campaigns.
- **DOJ Opinion Letter Scan Addition**: Build https://github.com/EqualifyApp/scan/issues/9 - Arguably most of the accessibility industry is a result of OCR work, so I do think people will be interested in seeing what OCR actually said.
- **"Open-Source Improves Access" Campaign**: Being open source is actually not that big of a draw for the people paying accessibility contracts. Most of people in charge of procurement don't come from a tech background, so they don't really understand how open-source projects actually improve accessibility. This campaign would help articulate why open-source projects improve access, building more value for Equalify.
