# "Bootstrap Equalify" Campaign

Blake is leading a campaign to develop Equalify's business. This document outlines the campaign and will be updated as it progresses.

## Goal

Secure a contract with one customer that meets our targets (see [/Business.md](/Business.md)) within eleven weeks. Concurrently, identify new Leads and Ambassadors while refining the sales approach.

## Timeline

April - June 19, with the possibility of extension if the campaign is successful.

## Thesis

Securing a contract with one customer will provide enough resources to continue building Equalify without the need for external investment. Avoiding outside investment without customers is important to prevent dilution of ownership at a higher rate than if we already had customers. By demonstrating product viability and generating revenue from customers, we can maintain more control over the company and its direction, while potentially attracting better investment terms when needed.

## Actions

The following actions align with the goals outlined in [/Business.md](/Business.md). Each action should have a metrically defined objective and timeline, along with potential next steps depending on whether those objectives are met.

### 4/3 - 6/19: Execute Intentional Actions, Documented in a Public Handbook

This entire campaign is an experiment to determine whether intentional actions yield positive results. The handbook will be updated regularly to organize actions. The goal is to secure a contract with one customer while understanding the process leading to that contract. Success will allow for the iteration of actions to grow sales, while failure will prompt a review of materials with trusted advisors and consideration of alternative approaches.

### 4/3 - 4/12: Develop & Release Tulane Case Study

Two centers at Tulane University have paid to manage their accessibility with Equalify. Upon deploying these solutions, a case study will be developed and shared with contacts in the higher education community via Slack and direct email. The objective is to finalize the case study by April 21 and generate at least 20 leads from sharing it in the week following. Meeting this objective will lead to a deeper focus on case studies and the potential for additional discounted work with other organizations. If the objective is not met, the value of case studies will be reevaluated.

### 4/3 - 4/12: Website Development Aligned with /Business.md Targets

The current website focuses on selling customized dashboard services. With the updated sales focus in [/Business.md](/Business.md), a redesign is necessary. The language will be updated to align with the new focus, and the call to action may be changed to "Request a demo" instead of "Contact Us." The website's effectiveness will be continually tested as the Tulane case study is released. During this period, the goal is to generate leads not directly emailed through the website. If leads are generated, the current approach will be iterated on; otherwise, alternative lead generation methods will be explored.

## Ideas

This running list serves as a rough collection of ideas for potential actions:

- **Publish a Survey of Government + Higher Ed Accessibility**: The survey, done in partnership with CivicActions, would outline accessibility scores of major institutions. We would promote the survey to channels and individuals to generate Leads. Meeting with CivicActions on 4/14 to discuss the viability of this campaign to generate leads.
- **Sponsor WPCampus party**: WP Campus occurs after this campaign (7/14) but could be initiated if the campaign appears successful. This action would also help determine the value of sponsoring informal mixers.
- **Give a Talk at HighEdWeb**: The talk "Open Source Accessibility Tool Survey" has been approved for HighEdWeb (10/8-10/11). If the campaign is successful and extended, this event might be included. It will be interesting to see if talks generate new leads.
- **Co-Design new features with a prominent Lead**: Collaborating on feature design with a prominent Lead could serve as a calling card for Equalify. For example, co-designing the reports view with Berkeley could lead to more Leads and Ambassadors if properly shared in relevant communities.
- **Take High-value Leads out to dinner**: A common sales approach is to take leads out to dinner. This strategy has produced mixed results in the past. The goal would be to convert leads into ambassadors, and this action would only be pursued if the Lead explicitly indicates that it would lead to a stronger connection.
- **Refocus the website on Custom Dashboard service**: If SaaS sales prove challenging, the custom dashboard service seems to be attracting interest. The downside is that custom dashboards do not scale as well as a SaaS service. A pivot to this approach should only be considered if subscription sales prove unattainable.
