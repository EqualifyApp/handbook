# Budget

We are working to realize an annual budget of around $500,000. That budget allocates cash for two developers, one project manager, one organization owner, and modest expenses.

The developers paid $105k each, would build out Equalify features, approve pull requests, contribute to roadmap discussions, and resolve bugs.

The project manager paid $85k and would set and maintain the organization's goals. That includes setting KPIs approved by the organization's owner, managing daily meetings, addressing support requests, and assisting in sales and community building.

The organization's owner paid $125k and would be responsible for all aspects of Equalify. Their tasks include:

- Approving final feature requirements.
- Approving changes to the roadmap.
- Working with investors.
- Approving estimates.
- Leading sales initiatives.

We would also need a small budget for expenses. Expenses include hosting for non-paying clients($5k), travel to conferences and demos ($15k), sponsorship of relevant events ($20k), and vendors ($35k) to handle accounting, specialized features, and legal needs.

Our $500k goal also includes about 15% contingency for additional expenses that may come up as we expand our services.
